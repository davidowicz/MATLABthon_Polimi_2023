# MATLABthon_Polimi_2023
Accelerometer and GPS data detection for stride analysis

## Project description
Our goal is to detect the lenght of the stride using the data of a walking person.
To understand more closely how we proceeded, have a look at the markdown cells of the notebook.

## Project structure
### Data folder
We collected our data using the "MATLAB Support Package for Apple iOS/Android Sensors", trough Acellerometer and GPS of a smartphone.
We used the following features:
- Acceleration along the x-axis
- Acceleration along the y-axis
- Acceleration along the z-axis
- Latitude
- Longitude
- Time

### Scripts / Notebooks
- Team8.mlx is the final notebook
- function.m has a function use to evaluate the total distance traveled, the cumulative distance at each time interval and the distance traveled at each time step

## Run instructions
To correctly run this project, just run the Team8.mlx file.
