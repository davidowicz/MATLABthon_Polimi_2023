# MATLABthon_Polimi_2023
Accelerometer and GPS data detection for stride analysis

## Project structure
### Data folder
We collected our data using the "MATLAB Support Package for Apple iOS/Android Sensors", trough Acellerometer and GPS of a smartphone.
We used the following features:
- Acceleration along the x-axis
- Acceleration along the y-axis
- Acceleration along the z-axis
- Latitude
- Longitude
- Time


## Run instructions

The `Signal Processing Toolbox` is needed.

To correctly run this project, 


## Hint

One expects a higher mean stride in higher people, here is a reference of the height of the people collecting data:

- Person 1_ height 160cm
- Person 2: height 174cm
- Person 3: height 192cm
