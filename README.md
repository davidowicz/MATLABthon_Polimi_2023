# MATLABthon_Polimi_2023

Accelerometer and GPS data detection for stride analysis.

## Project description

Our goal is to detect the lenght of the stride using the data of a walking person.
To understand more closely how we proceeded, have a look at the markdown cells of the notebook.

## Project structure

### Data folder

We collected our data using the `MATLAB Support Package for Apple iOS/Android Sensors`, trough Accelerometer and GPS of a smartphone.

We used the following features:

- Acceleration along the x-axis
- Acceleration along the y-axis
- Acceleration along the z-axis
- Latitude
- Longitude
- Time

### Scripts / Notebooks

- `Team8.mlx` is the final notebook.
- `compute_distance.m` has a function use to evaluate the total distance traveled.

## Run instructions

The `Signal Processing Toolbox` is needed.

To correctly run this project, just run the `Team8.mlx` file which contains the walkthrough of the analysis.

## Hint

One expects a higher mean stride in higher people, here is a reference of the height of the people collecting data:

- Person 1_ height 160cm
- Person 2: height 174cm
- Person 3: height 192cm
